      Orphans of Hope Uganda is a family-run orphanage lead by Nassejje Jane Jesca, the owner and founder.
      Growing up with a supportive family, Jane was inspired by the work of a local man who ran an orphanage in Kampala.
      From a very young age, she knew it was her calling to follow in his footsteps and help children who were in need.
      It
      was upon her arrival to Kyankwanzi in 1997 where Jane began her work as a teacher. Jane struggled to save money,
      while working various jobs as a mother of 6. As she raised her children, she would also help the less fortunate
      children in her community, as she was able. When her youngest child entered secondary school, she re-focused all
      her
      efforts on providing for those children who were abandoned and vulnerable. With her meager savings, she managed to
      purchase a small plot of land just outside the Ntunda town center. On this land, she went on to found the Good
      Samaritan Nursery and Primary School. The orphanage is based within the Good Samaritan Nursery and Primary School
      where Jane has been the Directress for almost 20 years.
      Janeâ€™s children continue to work at the orphanage as educators, striving to make a difference for the youth of
      Uganda.
      Jane is the strong matriarch of OHU, loving unconditionally and helping to better her community.
