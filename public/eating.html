    We have acquired several acres of land for the orphanage. After much discussion and speaking with others in the
    village, we came to a mutual decision and planted 800 banana trees on the acreage. As the trees grow and mature, the
    orphanage will be able to cultivate crops for market, and they will provide the orphanage with additional food. Our
    hope is to become self-sustaining with our land, where we will be able to grow enough food to nourish the orphans.
    We also hope to provide a steady income for the orphanage through the sale of excess crops. Children who have enough
    food to eat have better attendance and performance in school. Well-fed, healthier children are also less likely to
    suffer from stunting and other developmental delays.
    In the initial stage, the project will be sustained by donor funds. However, in the long run the project will
    finance itself. This will be a continuous project, improving food scarcity, empowering the orphanage, and
    contributing to improvement in health conditions.
