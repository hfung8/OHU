      Our orphanage is located in a remote village six hours north of Kampala, in the Kyankwanzi District of Central
      Uganda. Ntunda is a simple village living with basic means. The majority of the population are labourers and
      farmers. There is no electricity or running water. Not too long ago, there was only a single water source in the
      center of town providing for the entire population of Ntunda.

      The orphanage is a short five minute walk from the town center, with a simple brick home for the children, and a
      large avocado tree in the backyard. At the orphanage, we prepare a small breakfast of maize flour porridge. Lunch
      and evening meals consist of boiled maize flour, called posho, accompanied by beans. On special occasions, we are
      able to add vegetable and meat to our diets. The children of OHU spend their time attending school, playing games
      and being young kids.
