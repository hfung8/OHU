    Uganda consistently ranks as one the poorest nations in the world.[2] Uganda is still healing in the aftermath of a
    long civil war that claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and displaced millions more. Political unrest has
    resulted in frequent outbursts of armed conflict and massacres. Population growth is straining resources and
    government infrastructure continues to require much improvement. Uganda is experiencing one of the fastest growing
    refugee crises hosting the third-largest number of refugees in the world.[3]
