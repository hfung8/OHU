      We need volunteers who can bring new ideas, their passion for giving back, and a positive attitude. Our projects
      are only successful if volunteers bring value, and are willing to go the extra mile to help those in need. The
      ability to adapt and use your initiative will be the single determining factor in the success of your volunteer
      experience.
      We encourage our volunteers to take a different approach, and start fundraising in their hometown before their
      arrival. Volunteers typically use online platforms to fundraise for their upcoming stay with us. There is no
      specific program fee but financial resources are always needed for the completion of projects. We are open to
      group and collaborative projects that aim to build and strengthen our community.
      Your contribution to OHU will be real and authentic. You will change lives and gain valuable life experience. </p>

      Teaching – we educate over 200 students in our schools. We want to expose our students to new and creative
      classes. You’ll be expected to do daily lessons with a variety of age groups. While there is a language barrier,
      by volunteering you can introduce writing, art, dance, philosophy, life skills, etc. into our classrooms
      School and Orphanage Administration – staff and teacher training, applying for grants, fundraising, strategic
      planning
      Community Development – promoting small business development, the importance of basic education, and women’s
      rights and empowerment
      Building Construction – we are constantly aiming to expand or school and orphanage
      Farming – crop growing, animal care, cultivating the land
      Business Mentoring – help with accounting, budgeting, marketing, report writing and file maintenance
      Counseling – many of the children suffered through abuse, deprivation, and/or trauma prior to coming to the
      orphanage. We are looking for volunteers to provide training to local staff and caregivers about trauma and ways
      of coping, and help setup psychological service programs for the children
      Medical Outreach – mentoring youth and community members about HIV/AIDS, public health/hygiene, family planning,
      safe sex practices
      Orphan Care - caring for the children, helping with their education, playing games and arranging fun activities
      during leisure time - the children require a lot of care, attention and most importantly, companionship
      E-Volunteers - remotely volunteer by helping with various communication initiatives that target national audiences
      to raise awareness about our orphanage: help us build a blog, help us fundraise, manage our social media, create
      content for social media posts, etc.
      If you have project ideas that are not listed here feel free to let us know.
