    <p class="jumpingText">Orphans of Hope Uganda (OHU) is a registered non-profit organization based in Central Uganda. OHU
      was created in 2012 in response to the urgent need for action in caring for abandoned children. If a childâ€™s
      family or community cannot provide for those needs, it becomes our responsibility to provide for them. We provide
      complete care to the most vulnerable children in our area.</p>

      Our goal is to give vulnerable children a family atmosphere, within a loving and safe environment. Despite their
      struggles, our vision is to watch our orphans grow to be well-adjusted, happy, and productive members of society.
      We provide a happy home, healthy food, medical care, and an education.
