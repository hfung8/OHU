    Thanks to international donors, a nursery and a primary community school have been finished in Ntunda Village. They
    are fully operational and currently in use, allowing the children an education up to grade 7. The schools provide
    education to many of the children in the community. Many of our students have gone onto secondary schools, some
    receiving scholarships as a result of their high marks and hard work.
    Our school is now educating over 200 children, many of whom are total or half orphans. For these struggling children
    we provide free food, accommodation, and education. Other than donations, the only income for the orphanage is
    through school fees – which is approximately $9 USD a semester – paid by the students’ families, when they can
    manage. These school fees help to keep the school running and overage goes directly towards supporting the
    orphanage. Unfortunately, the high level of poverty means most parents cannot afford the fees. Because of the
    ongoing poverty, the school’s income is stretched very thin, consequently affecting the orphanage as well.
    We know education is essential and that is why it comprises the backbone of our services to the community’s orphans
    and vulnerable children. Because of the generosity of Jane, no student will be turned away from our school. Educated
    children have a greater advantage of being responsible, self-reliant citizens, compared to their uneducated
    counterparts.
