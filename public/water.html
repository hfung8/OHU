    We partnered with an international NGO who raised the resources to construct a new borehole to provide clean,
    accessible water to the orphanage and the surrounding community. Contractors drilled to the depth of 82 meters to
    find clean, potable water. Finding water was a daily concern for women and children of the village. The new borehole
    has reduced the time required to collect water, benefiting the childrenâ€™s education via several routes: they are
    increasing study time, fatigue has decreased, subsequently expanding their ability to retain and study their
    materials. Even the surrounding community has benefited from the new borehole, alleviating collection times for much
    of the population. Access to clean water greatly improves health and has a large impact on the alleviation of
    poverty.
